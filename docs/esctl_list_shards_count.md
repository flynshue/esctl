## esctl list shards count

List shard count for each node

### Synopsis


A good rule-of-thumb is to ensure you keep the number of shards per node below 20 per GB heap it 
has configured. A node with a 30GB heap should therefore have a maximum of 600 shards, but the 
further below this limit you can keep it the better. This will generally help the cluster 
stay in good health.
